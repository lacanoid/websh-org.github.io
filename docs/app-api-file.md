# WebShell App API

The connection between the app (in a sandboxed iframe) and the shell (in the parent window) is established through an async-enabled
messaging channel. The app side of the connection is managed by the `WebShellApp` object from the `@websh/web-shell-app` package.

On connection (immediately after the app is loaded), the app sends  to the shell its manifest, which consists of various meta data about the app and the description of its capabilities according to this API.

After connection, the app receives commands from the shell, which it executes and returns the resuls, or throws an error. 

## Manifest
````js
{
  String name,
  String description,
  String version,
  String author,
  String docs, // Documentation URL
  String icon, // Icon url
  Object api: {
    Object file: {
      Object formats: {
        Object "format-id": {
          String name, 
          String extension, 
          String type,
          String encoding,
          Boolean new,
          Boolean open,
          Boolean save
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
````
### File formats details:
* `name` - defaults to `"[format-id] file"`
* `extension` - defaults to `"*"`
  * You can specify several extensions, space-separated, without leading dots. 
  * Use `*` for any extension.
  * The first explicitly specified extension is the default extension used when saving files. If no default is supplied, the default is no extension.
* `type` - defaults to `"*/*"`
  * The expected mime type of files.
  * You can specify several extensions, space-separated. 
  * Use `*` for any mime type, or e.g. `text/*Ë™ for any text mime type.
  * The first explicitly specified type will be used when saving files. If it isn't supplied, the app will not be able to save files in this format,
* `new`
  * can this app create this file format?
* `open`
  * can this app open this file format?
* `save`
  * can this app save this file format?
* `encoding`
  * The encoding to be used when transferring this format. The valid values are:
    * `"text"` - The content is text and will be transfered as a string.
    * `"json"` - The content is JSON text and will be transfered as any JSONable value.
    * `"base64"` - The content is binary and will be transfered as a base64-encoded string.
    * `"binary"` - The content is binary and will be transferred as a `UInt8Array` buffer.
    * `"blob"` - The content is binary and will be transferred as a blob object.
    
  
  * If `binary` or `blob` is used, the ownership of the content will be transferred and e.g. no longer be available in the app after `file-save`.
  
## Commands

### file-open
The app receives the content of the file to be opened, as well as its extension and the ID of its format (this will be one of the formats specified in the app's manifest).

#### args
````js
{
  String extension,
  String format,
  content
}
````
* The type of `content` depends on the encoding specified in the manifest.

#### expected response

````js
"OK"
````

### file-save
The app receives the format and the extension of the file that is to be saved, and returns the content of the file that will be saved. 

#### args
````js
{
  String extension,
  String format
}
````

#### expected response

````js
{
  content
}
````
* The expected type of `content` depends on the encoding specified in the manifest.

### file-new
The app receives the format of the file that is to be created. 

#### args
````js
{
  String format
}
````

#### expected response

````js
"OK"
````
